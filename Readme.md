Password Generator

Implemented a Password Generator in Python that allows users to specify the desired password length. The generator ensures robust security by including a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special symbols. Features include user input validation for password length and a randomized character selection to enhance password strength and unpredictability.

Password Generator in Python
Objective:
Developed a robust Password Generator in Python to create strong and secure passwords for various applications and accounts.

Key Features:
Customizable Password Length:

Users can specify the desired length of the password (minimum 4 characters).
Inclusion of Character Categories:

Includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
Ensures at least one character from each category in every generated password for enhanced security.
Randomness and Shuffle:

Generates passwords with random characters using Python's random module.
Shuffles the characters to ensure unpredictability and strength.
User Interaction:

Prompts users to input the desired password length.
Handles exceptions and ensures valid input for a seamless user experience.

Implementation Details:
Utilizes Python's random module and string module to generate random characters.
Ensures strong password complexity by including a variety of character types.
Implements a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction and password generation.

Example Usage:
User inputs the desired password length (e.g., 8 characters).
The generator combines lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.
Ensures each category is represented and shuffles the characters for randomness.
Outputs a securely generated password ready for use.

Future Enhancements:
Integrate additional customization options such as excluding certain characters or generating multiple passwords at once.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for broader accessibility and ease of use.
